**Pizzaiolo's Delight Sales Analysis**


## Overview

In this project, I analyzed the sales data for **Pizzaiolo's Delight**, a rapidly expanding pizza restaurant chain. The goal was to uncover insights that could enhance the restaurant's operations, boost profitability, and improve customer satisfaction. This analysis offered a chance to apply my business intelligence skills to real-world data, supporting strategic decision-making for the restaurant's growth.
## Objective

The project’s primary aim was to use **Microsoft Excel** and its advanced tools to:

- Analyze sales trends and identify peak periods,
- Understand customer preferences for pizza types and sizes,
- Evaluate operational efficiencies, and
- Provide actionable recommendations to help management optimize the restaurant’s business strategies.


## Dataset

The dataset analyzed consists of:

- **Orders**: Details on each order, including the date and time,
- **Order Details**: Specifics of each item in the orders, like quantities and prices,
- **Pizzas**: Information on pizza options, including sizes and base prices, and
- **Pizza Types**: Descriptions of each type, including ingredients and category (e.g., Classic, Veggie).


## Key Questions Addressed

1. **Peak Times and Days**: When is the restaurant busiest, and when might staffing or promotions be adjusted?
2. **Popular Pizzas**: Which pizza types and sizes are most popular, and are there underperforming items that could be refined?
3. **Order Value**: What is the average revenue per order, and how could this be increased?
4. **Impact of Pizza Size on Sales**: How do different pizza sizes contribute to sales in terms of volume and revenue, and could pricing adjustments increase profits?
## Key Metrics Calculated

- **Total Sales**: Overall revenue from pizza sales.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average spend per order.
- **Total Orders**: The number of unique orders placed.
- **Total Units Sold per Pizza**: Units sold for each pizza type and size.

## Tools Used

To achieve these insights, I used:

- **Microsoft Excel** for data management, analysis, and visualization,
- **Power Query** for cleaning and transforming raw data, and
- **Advanced Excel Formulas** like VLOOKUP and SUMIFS for detailed calculations.
